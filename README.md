# Data-Science-Projects
This repository contains all the data science projects I've undertaken on my spare time.

Thus far the projects include:

1. An exploratory data analysis of regional sales data.
2. Machine learning classification of the Iris dataset.
3. Convolutional neural network to classify images of cats and dogs.
